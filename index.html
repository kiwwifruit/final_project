    <h1 id="main-title">Do Stress Patterns During Exams Reveal Hidden Insights About Students' Performance?</h1>
    <p id="subtitle">Stress plays a significant role in how students perform during exams.
        This dynamic visualization facilitates the exploration of how physiological stress markers‚Äîsuch as body movement,
        sweat response, heart rate, and skin temperature‚Äîrelate to exam grades by examining individual features and their
        combinations. The dataset includes exam data from 10 students across three exams, with their stress markers tracked 
        by a smartwatch-like device worn on their non-dominant hand throughout the exam period.</p>

            Each of the paired graphs compares two representative students with different grades.
            Since the data for different markers is recorded at different sample rates, 
            aggregation is done by exam time, with each point representing the average marker value per minute.

    <h2>Section 3: How Do Multiple Factors Combine to Predict Exam Grades?</h2>
    <p id="description1">While each factor provides valuable information, real-life stress responses are complex.
        This section allows you to explore how combinations of physiological markers work together to predict a 
        student‚Äôs exam grade. 
        <br><br>The predictions are generated by a <strong>linear regression model</strong> trained on an aggregated 
        dataset, where each data point represents the mean value of each physiological marker per student per exam 
        (30 student-exam combinations in total). The model uses four selected physiological markers (ACC, EDA, HR, TEMP) as features, with the 
        exam grade (percentage) as the label.
        <br><br>This section also allows you to explore how combinations of physiological markers work together 
        to predict a student‚Äôs exam grade using this model. Use the <strong>sliders</strong> below to adjust feature <strong>standard deviations</strong> 
        and explore how changes in stress markers affect <strong>grade predictions</strong>.

    <p id="description2">The Parallel Coordinates Plot below visualizes how various physiological features interact: 
        Vertical axes represent each marker (ACC, EDA, HR, TEMP) and the predicted grade. 
        Each line corresponds to a student‚Äôs data across the features. Color-coded lines indicate grade groups: 
        Dark Red: High grades (Q1), Light Red: Medium grades (Q2), Light Blue: Low grades (Q3), 
        Dark Blue: Very low grades (Q4), and Green: Model‚Äôs predicted grade line.
        <br><br> Follow a single line from left to right to see how a student's physiological responses influence 
        their predicted grade. Lines toward higher grade values indicate profiles associated with better 
        performance, while downward correspond to lower grades. Notice how higher ACC, HR, and TEMP values 
        generally align with higher predicted grades, while elevated EDA often correlates with lower scores.</p>
